Customised Raspberry Pi Kernel
Forked from original kernel at https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.

There are several goals here, the main and original one being to provide 
PPS through GPIO support, without requiring either manual patches, or 
application to out of date kernels.

My main branch (git checkout rpi-3.6.y) includes features from each below
branch, and possibly anything else I have worked on.

This branch will be regularly rebased on the upstream, and hence, current. Branches specific to a purpose have had their commits merged to a single patch where appropriate. Full commit history can always be viewed on the main branch.

BRANCHES

GPIO_PPS
Checkout this branch to access a kernel with only the PPS changes. These have
been merged to a single commit for easy review.

This patch is disabled by default. This might seem off if all you use it for is this patch, but it ensures the patch can be applied to systems not necessarily wanting it, without having GPIO pins dissapear on them. You can enable the CONFIG_BCM2708_GPIO_PPS option under "make menuconfig":
System Type->Broadcom BCM2708 Implementation -> BCM2708 gpio support -> BCM2708 gpio PPS support

Directly below the above configuration option, you will find CONFIG_BCM2708_GPIO_PPS_PIN, which, as you may gather, configures the pin to use. It's important that people aren't encouraged to modify kernel source to change a configuration option. It defaults to 24 once enabled.

Will produce a log visible in dmesg on bootup. This is quite useful - you should be able to tell if an option like this is configured. Particularly if you are trying to remember which pin you compiled it to use. Example:
bcm2708.c: Registering PPS on GPIO pin 24

CVE-2013-0871
This branch pulls in several upstream security fixes, fixing the named CVE.
